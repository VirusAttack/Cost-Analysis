Code is in Java.
The Cost.zip file has the project which I created using NetBeans IDE 8.1.
The Products text file contains my code in case you can't use the zipped project. (I would prefer if you use Netbeans only)
Screenshot shows the Input and Output format.
In input we just need to provide the quantity 1 by 1 starting from quantity of A then B and till I.

Only thing I assumed is that if the increase in cost was 8 for every additional 5kg weight then for additional weight less than 5kg, it is the same.
for example:    If the weight is 8,
		cost per unit becomes 10 + 8.  (10 for first 5 and 8 for the additional 3.)
I think this was supposed to be obvious but still for safe side I wrote it here.
